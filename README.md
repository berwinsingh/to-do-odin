# to-do-odin

A comprehensive To-Do application with the ability to add multiple tasks with dates, and priority.
Additional abilities include, note taking, adding task description.

This task is being done to hone everything that I have learnt with JS till now.

Current Known Bugs:
1. While creating tasks, if you have selected and deselected priority once, the program will only keep that priority in mind instead of reverting to the default of Low.
2. The user is able to select backdates for their tasks without there being a check
3. Task filteration is currently not working and needs to be added to the application
